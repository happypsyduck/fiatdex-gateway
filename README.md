# FiatDex Gateway v2 (Now retired)
Github Web Interface: https://happypsyduck.github.io/fiatdex-gateway/

This is a simple browser-based interface to interact with the FiatDex protocol. All code is client based via javascript and it does not connect to any centralized server. The marketplace listed below uses a centralized server to store offer data. FiatDex is a trustless fiat to crypto swap process. It uses game theory to incentivise each trader to complete a swap, otherwise face punishment for misbehaving. There are no arbitrators required or verification needed. There are no trade limits but as this is new software, trade responsibly and do not trade more than you are willing to lose.

# FiatDex Marketplace
Github Web Interface: https://happypsyduck.github.io/fiatdex-gateway/#marketplace

The FiatDex Marketplace is a simple interface to post buy and sell DAI offers. Users do not need to login and the offer data is stored up to 7 days from posting. This requires a centralized service to store offer data as SQLite database. Currently that server location is at: http://happypsyduck.mywebcommunity.org/interface/

Check the database folder to view the server code to setup your own orderbook interface. A proxy is used to allow cross site requests at: https://fiatdex-proxy.herokuapp.com/

## Disclaimer
The FiatDex protocol is based on audited smart contract code and has had automated audits but has not **had a comprehensive human auditor**. Keep this in mind when trading and do not trade with more funds then you are willing to lose. The code has been tested but please look at the smart contract itself and learn it before sending DAI to it. The code is provided as is without warranty. Use at your own risk.
